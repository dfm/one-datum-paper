\begin{abstract}
  The Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) from the \Gaia\ Mission includes measurements of the radial velocities of more than 7 million targets with the goal of providing a detailed view of the phase space of the Milky Way.
  Many of these stars are, in fact, members of unresolved multiple star systems and the effects of these orbits are generally seen as a source of contamination in the radial velocity catalog.
  In this paper, we the published radial velocity uncertainty estimates can provide evidence the existence of an unresolved stellar companion and, under the assumption of a gravitationally-bound binary system, place constraints its orbital parameters.
  We build a flexible data-driven model to estimate \Gaia's intrinsic per-transit radial velocity uncertainty as a function of color and apparent magnitude.
  Using these estimates, we develop a procedure for quantifying the outlier probability of a \Gaia\ EDR3 radial velocity target, and compute this probability for all targets with at least 3 radial velocity transits in EDR3.
  Finally, we derive a physical model for inferring the orbital parameters of the binary system based only on the published radial velocity error, the number of radial velocity transits, and the observational baseline.
  These parameters are generally only weakly constrained, with the exception of the radial velocity semi-amplitude, which can typically be estimated with a precision of $\sim PPP\%$.
  We expect that this value-added catalog will be useful for population studies of binary star systems, target selection for precise radial velocity surveys, vetting exoplanet discoveries, and other applications.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

By the end of the \Gaia\ Mission, it will discover SOME LARGE NUMBER of exoplanet and multiple star systems based on time resolved astrometry and radial velocities of many targets.
In the meantime, we only have static measurements of the radial velocity, but it turns out that there is still information in the existing public facing catalog to place constraints on the orbital parameters of multiple systems using the \Gaia\ data.
It has been previously demonstrated that the published radial velocity and astrometric ``errors'' can be used a proxy for multiplicity or data quality.
In this paper, however, we demonstrate that it is possible to use the reported radial velocity errors and a probabilistic model to place constraints on the radial velocity amplitude and, in some cases, some other properties of the orbit.
These measurements are useful for many applications, including \emph{(a)} discovering black holes, \emph{(b)} vetting transiting exoplanet discoveries, \emph{(c)} measuring the masses of a large sample of eclipsing binaries, \emph{(d)} quantify the binary fraction across the H--R diagram, and \emph{(e)} informing constraints on exoplanet formation and evolution theory, to name a few.

The fundamental idea of this paper is that even though the \Gaia\ catalog only includes a single RV measurement and its error, we can still make calibrated probabilistic inferences about the RV time series.
In particular, we know the number of RV observations that were used to measure the RV and its uncertainty.
Similarly, we can estimate the expected per-transit RV uncertainty based on the distribution of targets of similar color and magnitude.
Using these auxillary values, we can compute the expected distribution of RV error, and compare this to the measured value.
It has been previously identified that the RV error measurements scale with RV semi-amplitude (IS THERE A CITATION; add a figure), but below we take this one step further and derive an interpretable, physical, probabilistic model for this effect that allows us to directly infer the semi-amplitude, and weak constraints on the other orbital parameters.

In the following sections, we derive and discuss the components of this model, validate and characterize the performance using simulated data, and compare to archival binary surveys.
To start, we build a hierarchical probabilistic model to estimate the per-transit RV measurement uncertainty of the \Gaia\ survey as a function of apparent magnitude and observed color.

\section{The basics}

For each RV target, the \Gaia\ EDR3 catalog reports the median RV, an estimate of the error on this median, and the number of individual RV measurements (called ``transits'') that were used in this estimate.
In our analysis, we ignore the median RV and instead only consider the RV error and number of transits.
The RV error $\epsilon_n$ for a target $n$ is computed as \citep{Katz19}
\begin{eqnarray}
  {\epsilon_n}^2 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\,T_n}}\,s_n\right)^2 + 0.11^2
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:sample-var}
  {s_n}^2 = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T_n} \left(v_{n,t} - \bar{v}_n\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
is the sample variance of the individual RV measurements.
In Equation~\ref{eq:sample-var}, $t=1,\cdots,T_n$ indexes the $T_n$ transits for target $n$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
  \bar{v}_n = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{T_n} v_{n,t}
\end{eqnarray}
is the mean RV.
In all that follows, it is much simpler to reason about the sample variance ${s_n}^2$ instead of the error on the median ${\epsilon}_n$, but that isn't a problem because we can compute
\begin{eqnarray}
  {s_n}^2 = \frac{2\,T_n}{\pi}\left({\epsilon_n}^2 - 0.11^2\right)
\end{eqnarray}
for any target, using only values available in the catalog: $\epsilon_n$ and $T_n$.

With this out of the way, the basic intuition underlying the methods discussed below is that, for a given target $n$, if we know the number of RV transits $T_n$ and the per-transit RV uncertainty $\sigma_n$, we can estimate the sampling distribution for ${s_n}^2$.

\section{Estimating the per-transit radial velocity precision}

A key element of our analysis is that we must make a reasonably accurate estimate of the per-transit radial velocity measurement uncertainty.
The \Gaia\ pipeline does not release a public estimate of this, but it can be estimated from the data in the public catalog.
To make this estimate, the key assumption that we make is that the RV uncertainty depends only on a target's (reddened) $G_\mathrm{BP} - G_\mathrm{RP}$ color and apparent $G$-band magnitude $m_\mathrm{G}$.
While this is certainly not the full story, we discuss several validation experiments below and argue that this is not an overly restrictive assumption given the precision of our measurements.

\paragraph{A toy model}

To build intuition, let's start with a simplified toy model that we will extend below.
If we have a catalog of $N$ targets where only the sample variance ${s_n}^2$ of the RV time series and the number of observations $T_n$ of target $n$.
For our initial toy model, let's also assume that we know that the only source of noise is the per-transit measurement uncertainty, which we will assume to be Gaussian.
In this case, the generative model is
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{n,t} &\sim& \mathcal{N}(\mu_n,\,\sigma^2) \\
  {s_n}^2 &=& \frac{1}{T_n - 1}\sum_{t=1}^{T_n} \left(x_{n,t} - \left< x_{n,t} \right>\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_{n,t}$ are the individual RV measurements for target $n$ at time $t$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
  \left< x_{n,t} \right> &\equiv& \frac{1}{T_n}\sum_{t=1}^{T_n}x_{n,t} \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
In this model, our data are the empirical sample variances ${s_n}^2$ and we want to infer the underlying variance $\sigma^2$ that is shared by all targets $n$.
In other words, we must evaluate the likelihood function
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:noise-like1}
  \mathcal{L}(\sigma^2;\,\left\{{s_n}^2\right\}) &=& p(\left\{{s_n}^2\right\}\,|\,\sigma^2) \\
  &=& \prod_{n=1}^N\int p({s_n}^2\,|\,x_{n,t})\,p(x_{n,t}\,|\,\sigma^2) \dd x_{n,t}\quad.
\end{eqnarray}
From this equation we can see that the statistic $X_n$
\begin{eqnarray}
  X_n &=& \frac{(T_n - 1)\,{s_n}^2}{\sigma^2}
\end{eqnarray}
is chi-squared distributed with $T_n - 1$ degrees of freedom.
Therefore, Equation~\ref{eq:noise-like1} becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:noise-like2}
  \mathcal{L}(\sigma^2;\,\left\{{s_n}^2\right\}) &=& \prod_{n=1}^N \left|\frac{\partial X_n}{\partial {s_n}^2}\right|\,p(X_n\,|\,\sigma^2) \nonumber\\
  &=& \prod_{n=1}^N \frac{T_n - 1}{\sigma^2}\,p(X_n\,|\,\sigma^2)
\end{eqnarray}
where $p(X_n\,|\,\sigma)$ is a chi-squared density with $T_n - 1$ degrees of freedom.
In this equation, the Jacobian term is important since $\sigma^2$ is a parameter of the model.

\paragraph{A more realistic model}

In the previous discussion we assumed that the \emph{only} source of noise contributing to the RV sample variance measurement was the individual RV measurement uncertainties.
This isn't going to be true when working with real data since there will by other sources of excess noise, both systematic and astrophysical; in fact, that's the whole point of this paper!
To handle this, we add $N$ new parameters ${\delta_n}^2$ to our model, which we will add to the baseline uncertainty $\sigma^2$ when computing the expected variance for a target $n$.
With this change, our model is nearly identical to Equation~\ref{eq:noise-like2}, with $\sigma^2$ replaced with $\sigma^2 + {\delta_n}^2$
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:noise-like3}
  \mathcal{L}(\sigma^2,\,\left\{{\delta_n}^2\right\};\,\left\{{s_n}^2\right\}) &=& \prod_{n=1}^N \frac{T_n - 1}{\sigma^2 + {\delta_n}^2}\,p(X_n\,|\,\sigma^2 + {\delta_n}^2) \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
This is a very flexible model with more parameters than data points, but it is still possible to perform parameter estimation.

% To make this inference we build a probabilistic model for the reported distribution of ``radial velocity errors'' for a set of $N = 1000$ stars with similar colors and magnitudes.
% In other words, our dataset is $\{{s_n}^2,\,k_n\}_{n=1}^N$ where ${s_n}^2$ is the RV sample variance (as discussed above) for target $n$ and $k_n$ is the number of RV transits used to compute ${s_n}^2$.
% Then, we model the statistic
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \label{eq:rv-uncert-stat}
%   X_n &=& \frac{{s_n}^2\,(k_n - 1)}{{\sigma_0}^2 + {\delta_n}^2}
% \end{eqnarray}
% as being $\chi^2$-distributed with $k_n - 1$ degrees of freedom; where the shared measurement uncertainty $\sigma_0$ and the per-target excess noise $\delta_n$ are parameters of the model.
% This means that a model for $N$ targets has $N + 1$ parameters, but we will show that, given the right constraints, this produces sensible marginal estimates of $\sigma_0$ which is our primary quantity of interest.

% An intuition for the model defined by Equation~\ref{eq:rv-uncert-stat} can be gained by considering the case of a collection of $N$ targets known (by some other means) to be single stars without any excess systematic noise or outliers.
% In that case, for Gaussian distributed per-transit RV uncertainty, we would expect the quantity
% \begin{eqnarray}
%   \label{eq:rv-uncert-stat-basic}
%   X_n &=& \frac{{s_n}^2\,(k_n - 1)}{{\sigma_0}^2}
% \end{eqnarray}
% to be $\chi^2$-distributed with $k_n - 1$ degrees of freedom.
% However, in reality, some fraction of our targets are actually multiple star systems and some others might be outliers for some other reason.
% Therefore, we add the excess noise parameters in Equation~\ref{eq:rv-uncert-stat} to account for these effects.

\section{Binary probabilities}

One side effect of inferring the per-transit radial velocity uncertainty for all sources in \Gaia\ is that we also get (for free!) an estimate of the probability that the measured RV error is consistent with what we would expect if the individual RV measurements were Gaussian distributed with this uncertainty.
This is some sort of ``outlier'' probability, but we can use it as a proxy for binarity in the absence of systematic, or other un-accounted for effects.
We explore the limitations of such an assumption in the following sections, but it is useful for now to discuss the math for the idealized case here.

If each measured RV sample for a given \Gaia\ target $n$ was truly just generated as Gaussian noise with variance ${\sigma_n}^2$, the sampling distribution for the measured, normalized RV variance $X_n = (T_n - 1)\,{s_n}^2 / {\sigma_n}^2$ would be a $\chi^2$ with $T_n - 1$ degrees of freedom.
Therefore, we can compute the $p$-value for this null hypothesis as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathrm{Pr}(X > X_n\,|\,\mathrm{null}) &=& \int_{X_n}^\infty \chi^2 (X;\,T_n-1) \dd X \quad.
\end{eqnarray}
This is a useful number since, it can be used to construct a catalog with a specific expected false positive rate.

Specifically, we construct a binary catalog by selecting all targets with a $p$-value below some threshold $P_0$.
If our Gaussian model is correct and our estimates of the per-transit measurement uncertainty is accurate, then we would expect targets without companions to pass threshold with probability $P_0$.
In other words, setting $P_0 = 0.001$, we would expect 1 in 1,000 single targets to pass our cut and be incorrectly labelled as a binary.
This number does not directly map to the false positive rate, since that will also depend on the true binary fraction, however, it gives us a tuning parameter that can trade off precision and recall in our selection.

\section{Completeness \& reliability}

We would like to characterize the efficiency with which our method detects astrophysical signals from companions.
In other words we want to estimate the \emph{completeness} of our survey.
To do this, we use simulated injection and recovery tests where we generate simulated data with a known signal and attempt to recover it with our pipeline.
In particular, we will focus on characterizing the survey completeness as a function of the radial velocity measurement uncertainty and semi-amplitude, integrated over all of the other dimensions.
There are other parameters that affect the detection thresholds including, most importantly, the number of RV transits, but these are second order effects and we will marginalize over these effects using realistic distributions.

We use an approximate broken power-law model for the number of radial velocity transits:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:nb-transits}
  p(T_n) &\propto& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    1                                  & T_n < T_\mathrm{break} \\
    (T_n / T_\mathrm{break})^{-\alpha} & \mathrm{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray}
where the parameters are set to approximately match the observed distribution.
These parameters are set as follows: the breakpoint is $T_n = 12$ and the power-law index is $\alpha = 6$.
As demonstrated by SOMEFIGURE, this approximate distribution is a reasonably good fit.

Otherwise we sample the other parameters period, RV semi-amplitude, phase, eccentricity, argument of periasteron, and per-transit measurement uncertainty from the simple distributions listed in SOMETABLE.

Then we simulate an RV time series with $T_n$ observations sampled from Equation~\ref{eq:nb-transits} and compute the sample variance.
Then for consistency, we compute the floored and scaled ``error'' $\epsilon$ used to construct the \Gaia\ catalog (SOMEEQUATION) and, like the real catalog, mark any with $\epsilon > 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$ as non-detections.
Using this catalog, we evaluate the $p$-value for each simulated target, and then estimate its RV semi-amplitude.
Figure SOMEFIGURE shows the recovery rate as a function of RV semi-amplitude and per-transit measurement uncertainty.
At small semi-amplitude, the injected signals are not recovered since the variance is too small to distinguish from the measurement noise.
At large semi-amplitude, the signals are not recovered because the catalog is censored at large RV ``error'' ($\epsilon > 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$).
Figure SOMEOTHERFIGURE shows the inferred semi-amplitude for these simulations as a function of the true value.

These measurements don't fully capture all the limitations of this inference, but we will try to address some of those below by comparing to other binary surveys.

\section{A model for the radial velocity error}

Apparently \Gaia\ reports RV error $\epsilon$ defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \epsilon^2 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\,N}}\,s\right)^2 + 0.11^2
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
  s^2 = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{n=1}^N \left(v_n - \bar{v}\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
is what we actually want.

We need to compute a probability density for the $s^2$ parameter above conditioned on a set of $N$ noisy observations of an RV orbit (with some given parameters).
I'm going to model the noise as Gaussian with a known, constant variance $\sigma^2$, but it's \emph{possible} (although probably tricky) that we could relax some of that.

Next, the key realization is that if we have a set of $N$ Gaussian random variables $X_n \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_n,\,\sigma^2\right)$ (with known, but different, means $\mu_n$, in our case given by the RV orbit evaluated at $t_n$), then the random variable $Y = \sum X_n^2$ will be distributed as a noncentral chi-squared.
To use this to our advantage, we first argue that the argument in the variance sum $v_n - \bar{v}$ will be a Gaussian random variable
\begin{eqnarray}
  v_n - \bar{v} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_n - \bar{\mu},\,\sigma^2\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu_n$ is the RV orbit \emph{model} at time $t_n$.
This isn't totally obvious since the $v_n$ and $\bar{v}$ distributions aren't necessarily independent, but I think it's ok because [insert relevant math here] (this derivation will look similar to the sampling distirbution for the sample variance calculations so I should double check there, but this definitely works in practice).

Then we're where we need to be: $(N - 1)\,s^2$, our quantity of interest, is now the sum of squares of $N$ Gaussian random variables.
Following the Wikipedia page for the noncentral chi-squared distribution\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncentral_chi-squared_distribution}}, we need to rescale our parameters to have unit variance:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{v_n - \bar{v}}{\sigma} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\frac{v_n - \bar{\mu}}{\sigma},\,1\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where we have used the assumption that $\sigma$ is known and constant.
I think that we could allow non-constant $\sigma$ but that would result in a "generalized chi-squared" distribution which has no closed form\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_chi-squared_distribution}}.

Then the parameters of our noncentral chi-squared will be

\begin{eqnarray}
  k = N
\end{eqnarray}

and

\begin{eqnarray}
  \lambda = \sum \frac{N\,(\mu_n - \bar{\mu})^2}{(1 + N)\,\sigma^2}
\end{eqnarray}

And the parameter that is thus distributed is:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \xi^2 = \frac{(N - 1)\,s^2}{\sigma^2}
\end{eqnarray}

That was a bit ugly.
Let's see if this works with a simulation.
We'll simulate a single simple RV curve and then compute the distribution of $s^2$ over many different realizations of the noise.
